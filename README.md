# Hello world
We welcome contributors

# Our objective
Our primary objective in undertaking this open-source project is to provide a cost-effective database solution for companies, as the current costs associated with database management can significantly impact the pricing of drugs in the market. By offering a low-cost database solution, we hope to contribute to reducing the overall cost of drugs in the local market. We plan to achieve this by establishing agreements with companies that require our database for their processing needs.

Welcome everyone in new development.
Our ultimate goal is to offer an affordable and efficient database solution.
This is a new repositiory. I'm interested in creating a cloud-based Saas program that utilizes an open-source clinical database.
If you're unfamiliar with clinical databases, it's important to understand the basics before getting involved in the development of this project, which is open to anyone who would like to contribute.
Clinical databases are designed to collect data from various clinical trial studies, and enable analysis through post-marketing surveillance and pharmacovigilance. The primary objective of these databases is to ensure the safety of drugs by providing regular reports to regulatory authorities.
This database project is a cloud-based Saas program.
There are several key areas that need to be addressed when working with a database, including:
Database design: This involves creating a logical model of the database that defines the structure of the data and how it is organized. It involves defining tables, columns, relationships, and constraints.
Data modeling: This involves creating a physical model of the database that takes into account the specific requirements of the application that will be using it. It involves optimizing the database structure for performance and scalability.
Data storage and retrieval: This involves writing code to store data in the database and retrieve it when needed. This includes writing SQL queries to create, update, delete, and retrieve data.
Data validation and security: This involves writing code to validate user input and ensure that data is consistent and accurate. It also involves implementing security measures to protect the data from unauthorized access or modification.
Database administration: This involves managing the database environment, including configuring database settings, optimizing performance, and backing up and restoring data.
Integration with other systems: This involves writing code to integrate the database with other systems, such as web applications, mobile apps, and other databases.

Some of the specific codes that are commonly used are SQL (standard query language) which is used to create and manipulate databases,as well as programming languages such as Java, Python, and PHP, which are used to interact with the database and perform more complex operations.
Other important technologies may include database management systems (DBMS) such as MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server, which provide the underlying infrastructure for the database.

# We value our contributors
In the initial phase, our plan is to provide training to individuals who will be contributing to this project. As a token of appreciation, we have decided to allocate 12% of our profits to these valuable contributors. Our goal is to achieve this within a three-year timeframe.
