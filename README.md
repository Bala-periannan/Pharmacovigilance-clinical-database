# Pharmacovigilance-clinical-database
Welcome everyone in new development
Our ultimate goal is to offer an affordable and efficient database solution.
This is a new repositiory. I'm interested in creating a cloud-based Saas program that utilizes an open-source clinical database.
If you're unfamiliar with clinical databases, it's important to understand the basics before getting involved in the development of this project, which is open to anyone who would like to contribute.
Clinical databases are designed to collect data from various clinical trial studies, and enable analysis through post-marketing surveillance and pharmacovigilance. The primary objective of these databases is to ensure the safety of drugs by providing regular reports to regulatory authorities.
This database project is a cloud-based Saas program.
